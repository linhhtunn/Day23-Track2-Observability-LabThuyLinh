## 6. The single change that mattered most

> **Grader reads this closest.** What one thing about your stack design — a metric you added, a label you dropped, a panel you reorganized, an alert threshold you tuned — made the biggest difference between "works" and "useful"? Write 1-2 paragraphs. Connect it to a concept from the deck.
